# 👋 Hey there, I’m Fatma!

###  AI Engineer |  Builder |  Creative Thinker

I'm someone who likes to turn “what if” ideas into *working code*. Whether it's teaching a bot to understand Arabic, scraping meaning from pixels, or helping someone study smarter with AI — I’m all about **making machines useful**.

## 🔨 Some Things I’ve Built

 **Genie (AI Study Assistant)**  
A smart, chat-based tool that turns textbooks, PDFs, and videos into summaries, quizzes, and mind maps.  
_It’s like studying with a supercharged second brain._

 **Arabic Sign Language Translator**  
Built a real-time translator using CNN + ResNet with 98% accuracy.  
_Where computer vision meets accessibility — hands speak, code listens._

 **AI Food Order Assistant**  
An Arabic voice-to-order system that understands what you say and formats it for kitchen or app delivery.  
_Built for smoother service and less “can you repeat that?” moments._

**Data from Images (Vision Pipeline)**  
Automated extraction of structured data from messy images using OpenAI Vision models.  
_Fast. Clean. Reliable. Perfect for clients who hate spreadsheets._

## 🧠 How I Think

> "AI should be useful, not just impressive."

I'm not here to build things that end up in a drawer. I'm here to make things that get used, help people, and spark curiosity. If it’s practical, creative, or a little chaotic, I’m in.
