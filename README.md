# 👋 Hey there, I’m Fatma!

### 💡 AI Engineer | 🚀 Builder | 🎨 Creative Thinker

I'm someone who likes to turn “what if” ideas into *working code*. Whether it's teaching a bot to understand Arabic, scraping meaning from pixels, or helping someone study smarter with AI — I’m all about **making machines useful**.

- 💬 Obsessed with NLP, LLMs & multimodal models
- 📚 Always learning — quantum stuff, fast APIs, weird edge cases

## 🔨 Some Things I’ve Built

🧞‍♀️ **Genie (AI Study Buddy)**  
A chat-based assistant that turns PDFs and videos into summaries, quizzes, and mind maps. *(Basically, your brain’s backup drive.)*

🧠 **Arabic Sign Language Translator**  
Real-time ResNet-powered translator with 98% accuracy — because language should never be a barrier.

🍽️ **AI Restaurant Assistant**  
Listens to Arabic speech, understands the food order, and talks back — all automated, all smart.

📸 **Image-to-Data Pipeline**  
From raw images to clean data, fast. Vision models + smart engineering = ✨

---

## 🛠 Toolbox

**Languages:** Python, C++, JavaScript  
**Frameworks:** PyTorch, FastAPI, React, LangChain  
**Tools I ❤️:** OpenAI, Hugging Face, MongoDB, Docker, Git

I live somewhere between `def inference()` and `<div id="root">`.

## 🧠 How I Think

> "AI should be useful, not just impressive."

I'm not here to build things that end up in a drawer. I'm here to make things that get used, help people, and spark curiosity. If it’s practical, creative, or a little chaotic — I’m in.
